The insufficiency of normed spaces as a setting in which to find solutions to general partial differential equations has long been known, and yet they are still the spaces in which the majority of functional analytic study is  directed. It is the hope of the author to, in this document, exposit the theory of convexity and smoothness of a seminormed space and then to further generalize these results to locally convex spaces in the sequel, since the topologies of all locally convex spaces are produced by some family of seminorms on that space.
