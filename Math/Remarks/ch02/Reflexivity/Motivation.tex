\begin{rmk}

Recall that a \SeminormedSpace $X$ is said to be \Reflexive if $c(X)=X^{**}$. 
Since $X^{**}$ is always \Complete and $c$ an \Isometry, any \Reflexive space  \Complete.
Due to the Banach-Alaoglu theorem, 
the \ClosedUnitBall of a \Reflexive space
\weakly \SetCompact. 
For this reason and others, 
\Reflexivity is a condition of interest to many mathematicians. 
We begin with a basic result.
