As an easy application of \ref{thm:BanachAlaogluMorales} and \ref{thm:eberleinsmulian}, 
for a \Reflexive space X, 
all $x^* \in X^*$ attain their \Norm.  
The converse of this fact was, 
for a time, 
an open question of considerable interest. 
This problem has thoroughly been studied in the \Hausdorff case, albiet in a 
piecemeal manner.
The result was first tackled by James in \cite{james50} 
under the added assumption that every space $Y$ isomorphic to 
X has the property that each $y^* \in Y^*$ attains its 
\Norm and that $X$ permits a \SchauderBasis. 
This result was rapidly improved by Klee in \cite{klee50} who 
dropped the assumption of the existence a \SchauderBasis.
and then by James again in \cite{james57} who proved the 
result in the case of a \TopologySeparable $X$. 
The question of the converse in a \BanachSpace was finally answered to the affirmative in \cite{james64reflexivity}, building on the arguments in \cite{james57}.
I prove that the \Hausdorff assumption is unnecessary, 
showing in steps that the result holds in a general 
\Complete \SeminormedSpace.
