\begin{rmk}
\rm
    By \ref{prop:FilterBaseFacts:FiltersAreFilterBases}, 
    a \Filter $\scF$ is a \FilterBase for itself. 
    For this reason, in many of the following items, 
    we present propositions or definitions only in terms of 
    \FilterBases, understanding that the definition also then applies to 
    $\Filters$.
