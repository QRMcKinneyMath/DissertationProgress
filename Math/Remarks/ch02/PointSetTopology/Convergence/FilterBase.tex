\begin{rmk}

\rm
    By \ref{prop:FilterBaseFacts:FiltersAreFilterBases}, 
    a \Filter $\scF$ is a \FilterBase for itself, 
    and any \FilterBase is a \FilterSubbasis 
    for the \Filter it generates.
    For this reason, when stating definitions or results 
    about \Filters, 
    we will prefer to assume that an 
    object is a \FilterSubbasis if possible, 
    only resorting to assuming something is a 
    \FilterBase or \Filter when necessary, 
    and we will prefer to show that things
    are \Filters.
