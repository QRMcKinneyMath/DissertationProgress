\begin{rmk}

\rm
    By \ref{prop:FilterBaseFacts:FiltersAreFilterBases}, 
    a \Filter $\scF$ is a \FilterBase for itself. 
    For this reason, in many of the following items, 
    we present propositions or definitions only in terms of 
    \FilterBases, understanding that the definition also then applies to 
    $\Filters$. 
    Furthermore, a \FilterBase is a \FilterSubbasis
    for the \Filter it generates, so when possible, results 
    will be stated in terms of a \FilterSubbasis.
