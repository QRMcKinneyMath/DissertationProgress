\begin{rmk}[Quotient Normed Space]
\label{rmk:quotientnormedspace}
\rm
    If $(X,\norm{\cdot}_X)$
    is a \NormedSpace
    then by parts
    \ref{prop:QNS:Linear}, 
    \ref{prop:QNS:Surjective}, 
    \ref{prop:QNS:Isometry}, 
    and
    \ref{prop:QNS:Injective}, 
    $T:X \to \Ker_X$
    is an isomorphism of 
    \NormedSpaces satisfying
    $Tx=\{x\}$.
    For this reason, 
    as an abuse of notation, 
    later in this document,
    I may not distinguish between the quotient
    $X/\Ker_X$ and the space $X$ if
    X is a \NormedSpace, 
    and similarly, I may not distinguish between 
    $x \in X$ and $\{x\} \in X/\Ker_X$.
