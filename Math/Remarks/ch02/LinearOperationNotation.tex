\begin{rmk}[Adjoint]
\label{rmk:linearoperatornotation}
\rm
Let $X$ and $Y$ be \SeminormedSpaces
over the same \Field $\F$.
Let $T \in BL(X,Y)$. 
The adjoint $S:BL(Y,\F) \to BL(X,\F)$ of $T$, 
defined by setting, for each $x \in X$ and $y^* \in Y^*$, 
\begin{equation*}
S:BL(Y,\F) \to BL(X,\F) \tab[1cm] \ip{x, Sy^*} = \ip{Tx, y^*}
\end{equation*}
is well studied and understood. 
In this formulation, the author has found utility 
in replacing $\F$ with a more generic space, which 
motivates the following definition.
