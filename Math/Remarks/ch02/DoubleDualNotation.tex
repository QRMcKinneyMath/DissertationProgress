\begin{rmk}[Double (And Higher) Dual Notation]
\label{rmk:doubledualnotation}
    By \ref{thm:dualspaceisomorphism}, 
    if X is a \SeminormedSpace, 
    then $X^*$ is isomorphic to 
    $(X/\Ker_X)$ in a very natural way.
    Due to this, the double duals
    $(X^*)^*$ and $\pa{\pa{X/\Ker_X}^*}^*$ 
    are also isomorphic. 
    For this reason, if $x^{**} \in X^{**}$, 
    in addition to 
    \begin{equation}
    \ip{x^*, x^{**}}
    \end{equation}
    being defined, we will also consider it
    as being defined on 
    $\pa{X/\Ker_X}^{*}$, where we consider
    \begin{equation}
    \ip{\Omega x^*, x^{**}} = \ip{x^*, x^{**}}
    \end{equation}


\end{rmk}
