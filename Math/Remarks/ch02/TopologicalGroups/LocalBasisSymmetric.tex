\begin{prop}[Local Basis Symmetric]
\label{rmk:LocalBasisSymmetric}
\rm
It is clear by \ref{prop:SymmetricContained} 
that any \TopologicalGroup contains a 
\LocalBasis consisting of only 
\SymmetricSubset sets, 
and for any \LocalBasis
of a \TopologicalGroup, 
we can find a \LocalBasis
of the same \Cardinality
which is \SymmetricSubset.
\end{prop}
