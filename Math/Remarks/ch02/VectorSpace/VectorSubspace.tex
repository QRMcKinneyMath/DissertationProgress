\begin{rmk}[\VectorSubspace]
\label{rmk:VectorSubspace}
\rm
Let $V$ be a \VectorSpace over a \Field $\scF$.
Let $U \subset V$ be a \VectorSubspace. 
Then $U+U \subset U$. 
Furthermore, since for each $x \in V$, $-x = (-1)x$, 
$-U  \subset U$. 
Hence $U$ is a \Subgroup of $V$. 
Furthermore, since $B$ is \CommutativeFunction, by 
\ref{prop:CommutativeSubgroupNormal}, 
$U$ is a \NormalSubgroup of $V$, 
so the \QuotientGroup
$V / U$ is well defined. 
As shown in the next item, there 
is a natural way to turn $V/U$ into a \VectorSpace itself.
