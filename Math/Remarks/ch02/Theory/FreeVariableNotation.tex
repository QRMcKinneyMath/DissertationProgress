\begin{rmk}[\FreeVariable notation]
\label{rmk:FreeVariableNotation}

\rm
    Let $B$ be a \Wff in \scG. 
    Let $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$ be the \IndividualVariables
    which are \FreeVariable in $B$. 
    We will often denote $B$ as
    $B(x_1,x_2, \cdots, x_n)$, to give more information. 
    Furthermore, if $t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n$ are \Terms, 
    then we denote with 
    $B(t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n)$ 
    the \String produced by substituting each
    instance of $x_i$ in
    $B(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ 
    with $t_i$
    for $1 \leq i \leq n$. 
    Note that the resultant \String is still a \WFF.
