The following well known result concerning the 
\weakstar
\SetCompactness
of the unit ball of a
\BanachSpace was first proven in the 
\TopologySeparable
case by Banach, and then generalized in 1940 by Alaoglu \cite{alaoglu40} to \BanachSpaces. 
Generalizations of this result in a general TVS satisfying sufficient conditions 
have also been shown but the form presented here comes from \cite{hester07}, 
who drops the assumption of completeness for one direction of the implication. 
We further generalize this result to not require \Hausdorffness.
