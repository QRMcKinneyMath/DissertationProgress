\begin{rmk}
\rm
In this subsection, I develop a result 
which was studied in the \Hausdorff case in \cite{bishopphelps63},
which will prove useful throughout this document.
I begin by presenting the concept of a convex cone and a trio of lemmas which are commonly utilized in the proof of this result.
