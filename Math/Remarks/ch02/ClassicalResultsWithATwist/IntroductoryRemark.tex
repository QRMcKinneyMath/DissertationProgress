\begin{rmk}
\rm
May of the clasical results known to hold
for a \NormedSpace and its \TvsDuals do not actually rely on the fact that
the underlying space is \Hausdorff. 
As these results will be used in developing fixed point results 
for \GSpaces, we provide proof of such results below.
Since the author has not seen these results presented for 
a non-\Hausdorff space, so full proofs are provided in each case.
