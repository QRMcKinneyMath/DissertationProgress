The purpose of this section is to characterize the 
\weakly \SetCompact subsets of a 
\Complete 
\SeminormedSpace $X$.
The first main result of this section, \ref{thm:eberleinsmulian}, serves to show that even though 
the \weak \Topology of a \Complete
\SeminormedSpace is not in general \Metrizable
There exists an equivalence between 
\weak \SetCompactness and sequential \SetCompactness. 
From this  result $(1 \implies 2)$ was first presented in the case of normed spaces in \cite{smulian40}, and then $(2 \implies 1)$ was proven in the case of normed spaces in \cite{eberlein47}. Several different proofs have been given in the years since, and the one present here is based on that present in \cite{whitley67}, which is also followed in \cite{diestel84}. 
We begin with a few lemmas.
