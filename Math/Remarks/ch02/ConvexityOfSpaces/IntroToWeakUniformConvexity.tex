\begin{rmk}
\rm
Herein, we study two distinct notions of weak uniform convexity. 
The first, which is arrived at naturally by weaking the convergence conclusion that 
one can arrive at from the assumption that $\norm{x_n+y_n} \to 2$ where $\{x_n\}_{n \in \N}, \{y_n\}_{n \in \N} \subset \partial B_X(0;1)$, 
was first studied in 
\cite{}
and later in 
\cite{}. 
The second, which is arrived at by strengthening the hypothesis about $x_n+y_n$ required to conclude that 
$x_n-y_n \to 0$, 
has been studied in 
\cite{} 
and 
\cite{}.
