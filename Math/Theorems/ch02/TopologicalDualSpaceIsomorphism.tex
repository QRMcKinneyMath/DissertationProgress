\begin{thm}[\TopDualSpace Isomorphism]
\label{thm:dualspaceisomorphism}
    Let X be a 
    \SeminormedSpace.
    Define $\Omega:X^* \to \pa{X/\Ker_X}^*$
    by setting, for $x^* \in X$, 
    and for $x \in X$, 
    \begin{equation}
        \ip{x, x^*} = \ip{[x], \Omega x^*}
    \end{equation}
    Then $\Omega$ is a 
    Linear, 
    Bijective, 
    Isometric, 
    Bicontinuous operator. 
    That is, $X^*$ and $(X/\Ker_X)^*$ are 
    isomorphic, and that isomorphism is explicitly
    given by $\Omega$. 
    \begin{proof}
        Consider the following
        \begin{equation}
            BL(X,\F) \overset{q}{\to} BL(X,\F)/\Ker_{BL(X/\F)} \overset{\Theta}{\to} BL(X/\Ker_X, \F/\Ker_{\F}) \overset{\scQ_{\F}^{-1}}{\to} BL(X/\Ker_X,\F)
        \end{equation}
        where
        q is the \QuotientMap, 
        which is an linear bijective bicontinuous isometry in this case
        by parts 4, 5, 6, and 7 of 
        of \ref{prop:quotientnormspace}, 
        $\Theta$ is the \CanonicalIso, 
        which is a linear bijective bicontinuous isometry by 
        \ref{prop:canonicalisomorphism}
        and $\scQ_{\F}$ is the \CodomainQuotientMap.
        which is in this case a linear, bijective, bicontinuous isometry
        by \ref{prop:handedquotientoperators}


        Since $\Omega=\scQ_{\F}^{-1} \circ \Theta \circ q$, 
        and since each of the described properties
        are preserved under composition, 
        $\Omega$ is also a 
        linear bijective bicontinuous isometry. 
    \end{proof}
\end{thm}
