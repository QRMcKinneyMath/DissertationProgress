\begin{df}[\Homeomorphism]
\label{def:Homeomorphism}

\rm
    Let $\pa{X,\T_X}$
    and $\pa{Y, \T_Y}$ be \TopologicalSpaces.
    Let $f:X \to Y$ such be a 
    \ContinuousFunction
    \Bijection
	such that $f^{-1}:Y \to X$ is also 
	\ContinuousFunction.
    Then we say that \(f\) is a 
    \Homeomorphism from \(X\) to \(Y\)
    and we say that 
    \(X\) and \(Y\) are 
    \Homeomorphic
	and we say that \(f\) operates 
	\Homeomorphically.
\end{df}
