\begin{df}[Function \FunctionContinuity]
\label{def:FunctionContinuous}
\rm
Let $\pa{X,\T_X}$ and 
$\pa{Y,\T_Y}$
be
\TopologicalSpaces.
We say that a function
$f:X \to Y$ is 
\ContinuousFunction
and that it exhibits
\FunctionContinuity
with respect to $\T_1$ and $\T_2$
if
$f^{-1}(\T_Y) \subset \T_X$. 
We may make the \Topologies 
explicit by writing 
$f:(X, \T_X) \to (Y, \T_Y)$, 
in which case we just say that
$f$ is 
\ContinuousFunction
or that $f$ 
possesses 
\FunctionContinuity.
