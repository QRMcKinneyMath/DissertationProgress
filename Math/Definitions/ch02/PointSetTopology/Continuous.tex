\begin{df}[\ContinuousFunction]
    Let $(X,\T_X)$ and 
    $(Y,\T_Y)$
    be
    \TopologicalSpaces.
    We say that a function
    $f:X \to Y$ is 
    \ContinuousFunction
    and that it exhibits
    \FunctionContinuity
    with respect to $\T_1$ and $\T_2$
    $f^{-1}(\T_Y) \subset \T_X$. 
    We may make the \Topologies 
    explicit by writing 
    $f:(X, \T_X) \to (Y, \T_Y)$, 
    in which case we just say that
    $f$ is 
    \ContinuousFunction
    or that $f$ 
    posesses 
    \FunctionContinuity.
