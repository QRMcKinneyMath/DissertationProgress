\begin{df}[\SpaceOfContinuousLinearOperators]
    Let 
    $(U, \T_U)$
    and $(V, \T_V)$
    each be a \TVS
    over the same $\Field$
    $\F \in \{\R, \C\}$. 
    Let $L(U,V)$ denote the \SpaceOfLinearOperators
    from $U$
    to $V$.
    We denote with 
    $CL((U, \T_U), (V, \T_V))$ 
    the subset of 
    $L(U, V)$ consisting only of the 
    \ContinuousFunction operators. 
    When $\T_U$ and $\T_V$ are understood, 
    we may denote
    $CL((U, \T_U), (V, \T_V))=CL(U, V)$

\begin{rmk}[\SpaceOfContinuousLinearOperators is a \VectorSubspace]
    Let 
    $(U, \T_U)$
    and $(V, \T_V)$
    each be a \TVS
    over the same $\Field$
    $\F \in \{\R, \C\}$. 
    Let $L(U,V)$ denote the \SpaceOfLinearOperators
    from $U$
    to $V$.
    Let $CL(U,V)$ denote the \SpaceOfContinuousLinearOperators
    from U to V. 
    Then $CL(U,V)$
    is a \VectorSubspace of 
    $L(U,V)$.
