TODO: Clean this Up. It isn't actually clear to me how I should topologize
CL(U,V) for arbitrary TVS's' U and V. 
For now its fine, because so far i've only used the convergence in the case of a 
Seminormed space but eventualy I want to define a topology that
in the case where U and V are seminormed spaces, $CL(U,V)=BL(U,V)=$ the seminormed topology generated by their seminorms.

\begin{df}[\SpaceOfContinuousLinearOperators]
    Let 
    $(U, \T_U)$
    and $(V, \T_V)$
    each be a \TVS
    over the same $\Field$
    $\F \in \{\R, \C\}$. 
    Let $L(U,V)$ denote the \SpaceOfLinearOperators
    from $U$
    to $V$.
    We denote with 
    $CL((U, \T_U), (V, \T_V))$ 
    the subset of 
    $L(U, V)$ consisting only of the \Continuous operators. 
    When $\T_U$ and $\T_V$ are understood, 
    we may denote
    $CL((U, \T_U), (V, \T_V))=CL(U, V)$
