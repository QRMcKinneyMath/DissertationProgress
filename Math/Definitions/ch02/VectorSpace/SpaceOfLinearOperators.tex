\begin{df}[\SpaceOfLinearOperators]
\label{def:VectorSpaceSpaceOfLinearOperators}
\rm
    Let $U$ and $V$ be \VectorSpaces 
    over the same \Field
    $\F$. 
    We denote with 
    $L(U,V)$ 
    the set of \Linear
    operators $T:U \to V$. 
    We refer to $L(U,V)$ as the 
    \SpaceOfLinearOperators from 
    U to V.
    We endow $L(U,V)$ with 
    the operations of pointwise addition
    and pointwise scalar multiplication, 
    which makes 
    $L(U,V)$ into a \VectorSpace.
