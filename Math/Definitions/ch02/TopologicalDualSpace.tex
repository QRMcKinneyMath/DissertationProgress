\begin{df}[Dual Space]
\label{def:dualspace} 
\rm
    Let $(X,\norm{\cdot})($ be a 
    \SeminormedSpace.
    Let $X^*$ denote the \TvsDual of $X$. 
    Evidently, since $\F$ is a 
    \NormedSpace, 
    by \ref{prop:BLO}, 
    in addition to the \weakstar 
    \Topology, 
    there is an additional
    natural \Topology that can be placed on $X^*$.
    Namely, this is the \NormedSpace structure exposited on 
    within  \ref{prop:BLO}.
    From now on, when referring to the \TvsDual
    of a \SeminormedSpace, unless otherwise specified, 
    we are viewing it as possessing
    the \Norm \Topology, which is stronger than the \weakstar \Topology.
    Furthermore, since $X^*$ is now a \NormedSpace, 
    it has its own \TvsDual which is a \NormedSpace.
    Thus $X$ has \TvsDual spaces of all orders, all of which are 
    \NormedSpaces.
    For this reason, we call $X^*$ the 
	\FirstTopDualSpace
	of $X$.
