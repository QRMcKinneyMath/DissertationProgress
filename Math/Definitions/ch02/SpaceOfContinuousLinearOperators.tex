\begin{df}[Space of Continuous Linear Operators From a Seminormed Space into a Noremd Space]
Let $(X,\norm{\cdot}_X)$ be a \SeminormedSpace. 
Let $(Y, \norm{\cdot}_Y)$ be a Normed space.
We denote with $BL\pa{(X,\norm{\cdot}_X), (Y, \norm{\cdot}_Y)}$ 
the collection of continuous functions
$T:(X, \norm{\cdot}_X) \to (Y, \norm{\cdot}_Y)$. 
When the topologies on X and Y are understood, we denote this set with
$BL\pa{X,Y}$. 
We refer to $BL\pa{X,Y}$ as the \SpaceOfBoundedLinearOperators from X to Y. 

We endow $BL\pa{X,Y}$ with the algebraic operations
of pointwise scalar multiplication
and pointwise addition, making $BL\pa{X,Y}$ a vector space. 

We define $\norm{\cdot}:BL(X,Y) \to [0,\infty)$ by defining, 
for $T \in BL(X,Y)$
\begin{equation}
    \norm{T} = \sup\limits_{\norm{x}_X \neq 0} \frac{\norm{Tx}_Y}{\norm{x}_X}
\end{equation}
As will be proven in \ref{prop:BLO}, $\norm{\cdot}$ is a norm on $BL(X,Y)$, which 
we refer to as the \OperatorNorm on $BL(X,Y)$. induced by the
seminorm $\norm{\cdot}_X$ on X and the \Norm $\norm{\cdot}_Y$ on Y. 
\end{df}
