\begin{rmk}
\label{rmk:VerySmooth}
\rm
An inspection
of
\ref{cor:LocallyUniformlySmooth:Continuous}
and
\ref{prop:Smooth:JContinuous}
motivates definig a
notion of smoothness which is stronger than being 
\SmoothSpace but weaker than being 
\LocallyUniformlySmoothSpace. 
The existence of this property is further justified by its relationship 
with \Reflexivity.

\begin{df}[\VerySmooth]
\label{def:VerySmooth}
\rm
Let $X$ be a \SeminormedSpace.
Let $J$ be the \NormalizedDualityMap of $X$.
Let $x_0 \in X$. 
We say that $X$ is 
\VerySmooth at $x_0$ 
if there exists a 
selection $J$ which is \Norm
to \weak \ContinuousFunction at $x_0$. 
We say that $X$ is \VerySmooth
if it is \VerySmooth at each of its points.
