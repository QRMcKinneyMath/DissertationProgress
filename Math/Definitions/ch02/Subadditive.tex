\begin{df}[\Subadditive]
Let $G$ be a Magma and 
$H$ be a Totally ordered Magma. 
Represent the operation of $G$ and 
$H$ both with $+$. 
We call a mapping $p:G \to H$ \Subadditive if, for every $x,y \in G$, we have 
\begin{equation}
    p(x+y) \leq p(x)+p(y)
\end{equation}
Under these circumstances, we may also say that the operator p posesses $\Subadditivity$. 
\end{df}
