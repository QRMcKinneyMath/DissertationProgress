\begin{df}[\Predicate]
\label{def:Predicate}

\rm
    A \Predicate is a rule $P$ which assigns to any 
    set $X$ a statement $P(X)$ such that if $Y$ is another set, 
    then $P(X)$ differs from $P(Y)$ in that each instance of 
    $X$ in $P(X)$ is replaced with $Y$. 
    If $P$ is a \Predicate  and $X$ is a set such that $P(X)$ is true, 
    then we say that $X$ satisfies $P$. 
    If $P$ is a \Predicate and $X$ is a set such that $P(X)$ is false, 
    then we say that $X$ does not satisfy $P$.
