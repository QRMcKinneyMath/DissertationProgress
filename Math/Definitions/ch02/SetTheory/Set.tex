\begin{df}[\Set]
\label{def:Set}

\rm
    The basic object in mathematics is the \Set.

    The constrained view of mathematics offered in this document
    is that mathematics is the art of deriving 
    true statements about \Sets. 

    Pursuant to this view, we need to give some properties of sets
    to begin this deriving journey.
