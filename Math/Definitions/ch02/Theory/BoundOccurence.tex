\begin{df}[\BoundOccurence]
\label{def:BoundOccurence}

\rm
    Let $B$ be a \Wff in \scG. 
    Let $x$ be an \IndividualVariable that \AppearsIn $B$.. 
    We say that an \StringOccurence of $x$ is \BoundOccurence in $B$. 
    if either of the following two hold. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item That \StringOccurence is immediately preceeded by the \Symbol $\forall$.
        \item That \StringOccurence is within the \QuantifierScope of the quantifier
        $(\forall x)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
