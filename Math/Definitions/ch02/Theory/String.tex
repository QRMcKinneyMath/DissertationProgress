\begin{df}[\String]
\label{def:String}

\rm
    A \String in an \Alphabet $A$ is a finite ordered list of \Symbols in $A$.
    The number of \Symbols in a string is called the length of that string.
    A string can contain multiple instances of the same \Symbol.
    A \String may be represented by a character, or a sequence of characters.
    If we say that a character or sequence of characters is a \String, then we mean that
    that character or sequence of characters represents a \String.
    Suppose $x$ is a \String of length m whose $i^{th}$ element
    is the \Symbol represented by $x_i$.
    Then, for every counting number i between 1 and m.
    Then we write $x_i \SymbolEqual x(i)$.
    If $x$ and $y$ each are strings of length $m$ such that for 
    $1 \leq i \leq m$ we have 
    $x(i) \SymbolEqual  y(i)$, then we write
    $x \StringEqual y$.
