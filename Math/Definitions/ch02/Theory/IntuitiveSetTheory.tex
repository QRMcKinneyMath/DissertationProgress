\begin{df}[\IntuitiveSetTheory]
\label{def:IntuitiveSetTheory}

\rm
    Any mathematical theory has a collection of axioms, 
    or a set of axiom schema including set theory. 
    For this reason, any axiomatic theory, including set theory
    cannot itself be defined
    without some intuitive notion of set, collection, or class.
    Basically, an intuitive set is any well defined collection of items. 
    Intuitive set theory has its issues, but we will mostly sweep those under the rug
    and use it as the basis for propositional logic, and set theory itself.
