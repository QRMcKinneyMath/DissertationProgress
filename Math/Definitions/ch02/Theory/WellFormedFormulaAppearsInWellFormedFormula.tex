    Let $B$ and $C$ be 
    \Wffs
    in $\scG$. 
    We say that $B$
    \WFFAppearsInWFF 
    $C$ 
    if and only if 
    one or more of the following hold. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $C \StringEqual B$. 
        \item $C \StringEqual (\neg B)$.
        \item There is a \WFF $D$ in \scG such that $C \StringEqual (B \implies D)$. 
        \item There is a \WFF $E$ in \scG such that $C \StringEqual (E \implies B)$. 
        \item There is an \IndividualVariable $y$ in $\scA$ such that 
        $C \StringEqual ((\forall y)B)$
        \item There is a \WFF $F$ in $\scG$ such that $B$ \WFFAppearsInWFF $F$ 
        and $F$ \WFFAppearsInWFF $C$.
