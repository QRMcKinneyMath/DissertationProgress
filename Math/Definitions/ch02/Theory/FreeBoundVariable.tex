\begin{df}[\FreeVariable, \BoundVariable]
\label{def:FreeBoundVariable}

\rm
    Let $B$ be a \Wff in \scG.
    Let $x$ be an \IndividualVariable that \AppearsIn $B$. 
    We say that $x$ is \FreeVariable in $B$
    if it has an \StringOccurence that is \FreeOccurence in $B$. 
    We say that $x$ is \BoundVariable in $B$
    if it has an \StringOccurence that is \BoundOccurence in $B$. 

    Note that $x$ can be both
    \FreeVariable
    and 
    \BoundVariable
    in $B$.
