\begin{df}[\Character]
\label{def:Character}

\rm
   A \Character is a splotch of ink on a page 
   or lights on a screen that can be recognized as such.
   They are the means by which we communicate math, but are not
   in and of themselves mathematical objects.
   Roughly they act as the silent interfaces between different people's brains, 
   and notably between my own brain and this document, as well as your 
   brain and this document. 
   \Characters exist outside of mathematics. 
   A \Character can represent a mathematical concept, 
   but is not actually that concept, though we may sometimes say 
   that as an abuse of language.
