We will explore two primary methods for obtaining the existence of fixed 
points of operators on \GSpaces.
The first of these methods, 
which will be illustrated via the case study of  asymptotically nonexpansive mappings, 
is applicable to the extension of \PseudoFixedPoint theorems on \Complete \SeminormedSpaces which lack a boundary condition hypothesis to a \GSpace. 
The second, which will be illustrated by the case study of continuous pseudocontractive mappings satisfying the weakly inward condition, is applicable to the extension of PseudoFixedPoint theorems on \Complete \SeminormedSpaces for which there exists a known iteration method which converges to the fixed point. 
We first present some general results which we will apply to these two cases.
