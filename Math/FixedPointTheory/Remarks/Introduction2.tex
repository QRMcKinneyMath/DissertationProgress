The goal of this section is to prove that if $X $ is a 
suitably chosen \GSpace
and $K \subset X$ is suitably chosen, 
then any 
\Coherently
\PseudoAsymptoticallyNonexpansive
$T:K \to K$  has a \FixedPoint.
This is not a case covered by standard metric fixed point theory 
because a \Coherently \AsymptoticallyNonexpansive operator defined on a \GSpace 
is not necessarily \AsymptoticallyNonexpansive with respect to the 
metric on $X$.
To see this, consider the \PseudometricSpace 
$L^p_{loc}$ of measurable functions defined on $[0,\infty)$ 
whose absolute value integral over any \SetCompact set is finite,
where convergence is defined in $L^p$ on any \SetCompact set. 
Consider the sequence of \Seminorms $\{\norm{\cdot}_i\}_{i \in \N}$ 
on $L^p_{loc}$ defined by 
\begin{equation*}
\norm{f}_i = \pa{\int\limits_0^i |f|^p}^{1/p}
\end{equation*}
Now, define $T:L^p_{loc} \to L^p_{loc}$ by 
\begin{equation*}
Tf(x)=\begin{dcases}
0 & x \in [0,1)\\
k^2f(x-1) & x \in [k-1,k) 
\end{dcases}
\end{equation*}
Then, for each $i \in \N$, and for each $x,y \in L^p_{loc}$, 
we have 
\begin{equation*}
\norm{T^ix-T^iy}_i^i = 0
\end{equation*}
Hence, $T$ is \AsymptoticallyNonexpansive in the 
\GSpace sense, but
$T$ is not \AsymptoticallyNonexpansive, 
or even asymptotically Lipschitz in 
the \Pseudometric sense.
