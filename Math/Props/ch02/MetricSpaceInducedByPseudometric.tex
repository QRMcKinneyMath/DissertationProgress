\begin{prop}[Metric Space Induced By Pseudometric Space]
    \label{prop:pseudometricinducedmetric}
    %Let $X$, d, $\cong$, and $\tilde{d}$ be defined as in \ref{def:pseudometricinducedmetric}
    Let $(X,d)$ be a \PseudometricSpace, $\cong$ the \RelationOfZeroDistance on $(X,d)$ and $\tilde{d}$ be defined as in \ref{def:pseudometricinducedmetric}.
    Let $(X/\cong, \T_{X/\cong})$ be the  \QuotientTopologicalSpace with \QuotientMap T, and let $(X/\cong, \T_{\tilde{d}})$ be the topological space induced by the metric space $(X/\cong, \tilde{d})$. 
    The following are true. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\tilde{d}$ is in fact well defined, and is a metric on $X/\cong$, justifying calling it the \MetricInducedByPseudometric d.
        \item $\T_{X/\cong} = \T_{\tilde{d}}$
        \item T is an isometry from $(X,d)$ to $(X/\cong, \tilde{d})$
        \item $(X/\cong, \tilde{d})$ is complete if and only if $(X, d)$ is \PseudometricComplete.
        \item If $T:$
    \end{enumerate}
