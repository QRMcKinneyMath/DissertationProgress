
\begin{prop}[Equal Neighborhood Filters Equivalence Relation]
    \label{prop:EqualNeighborhoodFiltersEquivalenceRelation}
    
    The relation of equal neighborhood filters $\cong$ on a topological space $(Z,\T_Z)$ forms an equivalence relation on Z. 
    \begin{proof}
        Falls directly from the fact that set equality is an equivalence relation. 
    \end{proof}
