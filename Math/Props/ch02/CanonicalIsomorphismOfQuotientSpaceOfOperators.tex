\begin{prop}[Canonical Isomorphism Of The Quotient Space Of Continuous Linear Operators]
\label{prop:canonicalisomorphism}
    Let $X,Y$ be \SeminormedSpaces.
    Let $\Theta$ denote the \CanonicalIso
    from X to Y. 
    Then $\Theta$ is
    a bijective, bicontinuous, linear, isometry. 
    \begin{proof}
       By \ref{prop:quotientnormspace}, part 1, 
       $Y/\Ker_Y$ is a \NormedSpace, 
       Hence by \ref{prop:BLO}, part 2, 
       \newline
       $BL(X/\Ker_X, Y/\Ker_Y)$ is a \NormedSpace. 
       Similarly, by \ref{prop:quotientnormspace}, part 1, 
       $BL(X,Y)/\Ker$ is a normed space. 
       Hence, it is sufficient to show that $\Theta$ is a
       well-defined surjective linear isometry. 

       For well definedness, let $T,S \in BL(X,Y)$ with $[T]=[S]$. 
       Then, $\norm{T-S}=0$, so 
       if $x \in X$, $\norm{Tx-Sx}=0$. 
       Hence $Tx \cong Sx$ and since x was arbitrary, 
       $QT=QS$. 
        
       Let q denote the \QuotientMap $q:BL(X,Y) \to BL(X,Y)/\Ker$. 
       By parts 4, 5, and 6 of \ref{prop:quotientnormspace}, 
       q is a linear surjective isometry. 
       Also, by definition, $\Theta \circ q = Q$. 
       Since Q is surjective, $\Theta$ is surjective. 
       Since $Q$ is an isometry, and $q$ is a surjecive isometry, 
       $Theta$ is an isometry. 
       Since Q is linear, and since q is surjective and linear, 
       $\Theta$ is linear. 
    \end{proof}
