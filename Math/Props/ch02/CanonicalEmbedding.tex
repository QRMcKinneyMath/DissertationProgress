\begin{prop}[Canonical Embedding]
\label{prop:canonicalembedding}
    Let $X$ be a \SeminormedSpace 
    and let $c$ denote its 
    \CanonicalEmbedding. 
    The following are true. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item c is well defined
        \item c is Linear. 
        \item c is an isometry. 
        \item c is an injection if and only if X is a \NormedSpace. 
        \item Using the abuse of notation described in 
        \ref{rmk:doubledualnotation}, 
        if $q:X \to X/\Ker$ is the \QuotientMap, 
        then $c_X=c_{X/\Ker} \circ q$. 
        \item $c_X$ is surjective if and only if 
        $c_{X/\Ker}$ is surjective. 
        \item X is \Reflexive if and only if $X/\Ker$ is \Reflexive.
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of 1]
        I just need to show that for any 
        $x \in X$, $c(x)$ is
        conintuous and
        linear. 
        For continuity,
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of 2]
        Let $\alpha \in \F$ and $x,y \in X$.
        Let $x^* \in X$. 
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of 3]
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of 4]
    \end{proof}
    \begin{proof}[Proof of 5]
    \end{proof}
