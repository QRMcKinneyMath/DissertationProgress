\begin{prop}
\label{prop:quotientspreservecompleteness}
Let $(X,\norm{\cdot})$ be a \SeminormedSpace with \QuotientNormedSpace $(X/\Ker, \norm{\cdot}_{\Ker})$. 

Then X is \PseudometricComplete if and only if $X/\Ker$ is complete. 

\begin{proof}
Let X be \PseudometricComplete. 
Let $\{[x_i]\}_{i \in \N} \subset X/\Ker$ be a \PseudometricCauchySequence. 
Let $\epsilon > 0$. 
Then there is an $N \in \N$ such that for $m,n > N$ we have 
\begin{equation}
\norm{[x_m-x_n]}_{\Ker} < \epsilon
\end{equation}

For this N, we have 
\begin{equation}
\norm{x_m-x_n} = \norm{[x_m-x_n]}_{\Ker} < \epsilon
\end{equation}
so that $\{x_i\}_{i \in \N}$ is a \PseudometricCauchySequence. 
Since X is \PseudometricComplete, 
there is a 
$x \in X$ such that $\norm{x_i-x} \to 0$, 
but since T is an isometry, 
\begin{equation}
\norm{[x]-[x_i]}=\norm{[x_i-x]}_{\Ker} \to 0
\end{equation}
and so 
$[x_i] \to [x]$.
so that $X/\Ker$ is complete. 

Now suppose instead that $X/\Ker$ is complete 
and suppose $\{x_i\}_{i \in \N}$ is a \PseudometricCauchySequence in X. 
Since $\norm{[x_i-x_j]}_{\Ker} = \norm{x_i-x_j}$, 
$\{[x_i]\}_{i \in \N}$ is a \PseudometricCauchySequence in $X/\Ker$, which therefore has a 
limit $y \in X/\Ker$. Since T is surjective, $y=[x]$ for some $x \in X$, and it is easy to see that
$x_i \to x$ so that $X$ is \PseudometricComplete. 

\end{proof}
