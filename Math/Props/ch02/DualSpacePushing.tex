\begin{prop}
    \label{prop:dualspacepushing}
    Let $X,Y$ be \SeminormedSpaces.
    Let $T:X \to Y$ be a
    linear, 
    surjective
    isometry. 
    Define $T^*:X^* \to Y^*$ by 
    setting, for $x^* \in X^*$ and
    $x \in X$, 
    \begin{equation}
    \ip{Tx, T^*x^*} = \ip{x,x^*}
    \end{equation}
    Then $T^*$ is a Linear Bijective Isometry. 
    \begin{proof} 
        I first need to show that $T^*$ is well defined.
        Suppose $Tx \cong Ty$. 
        Since T is an isometry, $x \cong y$. 
        Hence, $\ip{x,x^*} = \ip{y,x^*}$ for all 
        $x^* \in X^*$. so the equation 
        defining $T^*x^*$ is at least consistent. 
        Is $T^*x^*$ linear? Yes, as 
        if $x_1,y_1 \in Y$ and $\alpha \in \F$, 
        then there are $x,y \in X$ such that 
        $Tx=x_1$, $Ty=y_1$, and 
        \begin{align*}
            \ip{\alpha x_1+y_1, T^*x^*} & = \ip{\alpha x+y, x^*}\\
            & = \alpha \ip{x,x^*}+\ip{y,x^*}\\
            & = \alpha \ip{x_1, T^*x^*}+ \ip{y_1, T^*x^*}
        \end{align*}
        Boundedness of $T^*x^*$ will be shown during the 
        proof that $T^*$ is an isometry. 



    For linearity, let $x_i^* \in X^*$ for 
    $i \in \{0,1\}$ and let $\alpha \in \F$. 
    Let $y \in Y$. 
    Since T is surjective, there exists $x \in X$ 
    such that $y=Tx$.
    Then
    \begin{align*}
        \ip{y, T^*\pa{\alpha x_0^*+x_1^*}} & = \ip{x, \alpha x_0^*+x_1^*} \\
        & = \alpha \ip{x, x_0^*} + \ip{x, x_1^*} \\
        & = \alpha \ip{y, Tx_0^*}+ \ip{y, Tx_1^*}\\
        & = \ip{y, \alpha T^* x_0^* + T^* x_1^*}
    \end{align*}

    For surjectivity, let $y^* \in Y^*$. 
    To prove the existence of $x^* \in X^*$ 
    such that $T^*x^* = y^*$, 
    it is sufficient to find$ x^*\in X$
    with $Kernel(T x^*)=Kernel(y^*)$. 


    To see that $T^*$ is an isometry, 
    let $x^* \in X^*$. Then, 
    since T is surjective and an isometry, 
    \begin{equation*}
    \{y \in Y| \norm{y} \neq 0  \} = \{Tx | \norm{x} \neq 0\}
    \end{equation*}
    , which allows us to say that
    \begin{align*}
    \norm{T^*x^*} &= \sup\limits_{\norm{y} \neq 0} \frac{\abs{\ip{y, T^*x}}}{\norm{y}}\\
    &= \sup\limits_{\norm{x} \neq 0} \frac{\abs{\ip{Tx, T^*x^*}}}{\norm{Tx}} \\
    & = \sup\limits_{\norm{x} \neq 0} \frac{\abs{\ip{x,x^*}}}{\norm{x}}\\
    & = \norm{x^*}
    \end{align*}
    so $T^*$ is an isometry. 
    Since $T^*$ is an isometry, and 
    $X^*$ and $Y^*$ are both normed spaces by 
    \ref{thm:dualspaceisomorphism}, 
    $T^*$ is surjective. 

    \end{proof}
