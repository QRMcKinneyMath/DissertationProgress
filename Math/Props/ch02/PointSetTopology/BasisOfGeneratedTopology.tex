\begin{prop}[Bassis Of Generated Topology]
\label{prop:BasisOfGeneratedTopology}
    Let $X \neq \emptyset$ and let 
    $B \subset \scPowerSet{X}$
    Then $B$ is a 
    \TopologyBasis 
    for 
    \scGeneratedTopology{X}{B}
    if and only if 
    the following hold
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $X \in B$
        \item $\emptyset \in B$. 
        \item For each $U,V \in B$, For each $x \in U \cap V$, there is a $W \in B$ with $x \in W \subset U \cap V$. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{proof}
        I first claim that 
        it is sufficient to show that any finite intersection of elements of $B$ can 
        be written as a union of elements of $B$.
        By Induction, proving for a binary intersection is sufficient. 
        Hence, let $U,V \in B$ with $U \cap V \neq \emptyset$. 
        Then for each $x \in U \cap V$, by assumption, 
        there exists a $W_x \in B$ such that 
        $x \in W_x \subset U \cap V$. 
        Hence, we can write 
        \begin{equation*}
            U \cap V \subset \bigcup_{x \in U \cap V} W_x \subset U \cap V
        \end{equation*}
        showign that finite intersctions of 
        elements of $B$ can be written as unions of 
        elements of $B$. 
        Hence, by
        \ref{prop:CharacterizationOfGeneratedTopoology}, 
        $\scGeneratedTopology{X}{B}$ 
        consists of exactly the unions of elements of $B$, finishing one direction.
        For the other direction, 
        if $B$ is a 
        \TopologyBasis
        for $\scGeneratedTopology{X}{B}$, 
        then 
        by 
        \ref{prop:TopologyBasisCharacterization}, 
        sicnce $\scGeneratedTopology{X}{B}$ 
        contains finite intersections of elements of $B$, 
        the given properties hold. 
       
        

    \end{proof}
