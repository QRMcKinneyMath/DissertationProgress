\begin{prop}
\label{prop:WeakstarSeparable}
\rm
Let $X$ be a \Separable \SeminormedSpace.
Let $B_{X^*}$ denote the \ClosedUnitBall of $X^*$. 
Then $B_{X^*}$ is \Separable.
\begin{proof}
Let $\{x_i\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be \DenseSet in $X$. 
Define the space 
\begin{equation*}
K = \prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{N}} [-\norm{x_i}, \norm{x_i}]
\end{equation*}
Endow $K$ with the \ProductTopology.
By tychonoff, $K$ is \SetCompact.
By taking the sup metric, we also see that $K$ is \Metrizable. 
Since a \SetCompact metric space is \Separable, $K$ is \Separable.
so $K$ is \Separable.
Define $T:B_{X^*} \to K$ by 
\begin{equation*}
\pa{Tj}_i =  \ip{j, c(x_i)}
\end{equation*}
Since each $j \in X^*$ is \ContinuousFunction, it is defined on a 
\DenseSet and therefore $T$ is \Injective. 
$T$ is also clearly \weakstar \ContinuousFunction. 
Since $B_{X^*}$ is \CompactSet, 
and since $T$ is \ContinuousFunction, 
$T$ maps 
\SetClosed sets into $\CompactSet$ sets, 
which are \SetClosed in $K$ because $K$ is \Hausdorff.
Thus $T^{-1}:Range(T) \to B_{X^*}$ is \ContinuousFunction. 
Since a subspace of a separable metric space is separable, we conclude $Range(T)$ is 
\Separable. 
Since $T:B_{X^*} \to Range(T)$ is a \Homeomorphism, $B_{X^*}$ is \Separable.
\end{proof}
