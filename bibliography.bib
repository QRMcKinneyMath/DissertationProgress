The second part deals with the applications of such calculations to the argon-hydrogyen mixture.  The collision integrals are determined from the selected interaction potentials or from transfer cross-sections.  The plasma compostion (in LTE) is calculated at atmospheric pressure by the free energy minimization procedure and for temperatures varying from 500 to 15000 K.  The transport properties (dynamic viscosity, thermal and electrical conductivity) are calculated for five values of the H2/(H2+ Ar) ratio:  From pure hydrogen to pure argon by 25% incrementation.  In the computer program, data (collision integrals and partition functions) have been expressed as polynomial forms.  At last, our results are compared to those of the literature.},

   Address = {Liverpool, England},
      Month = {Aug 25},
      Abstract = {Dear Matt,
           I have a data base of x-sections that are used in the magboltz solver. The x-section set uses not only momentum transfer x-sections but also real x-sections. The reason for this is that in some gases the momentum transfer approximation is not good enough at the 1% level of accuracy and the angular distributions must be taken into account. However for MHD applications I would expect the momentum transfer x-sections would be adequate.
 I have attached a gizped fortran listing of magboltz.
There is some descriptions and references in the comments section at the begining of the program that you should read.
The x-sections are listed in the  various relevant gas subroutines. Be careful when reading the subroutines some x-sections are given analytically some are tabulated and some x-sections are mixtures of tables and analytical functions.
 note I have recently added germane and silane to the data base.

  I will be more easily contactable from next week at the following e-mail address:
   stephen.biagi@hotmail.co.uk
    rather than
    sfb@hep.ph.liv.ac.uk
You might also find some nice plots of the x-sections on the cern web
page:
  http://rjd.home.cern.ch/rjd/cgi-bin/cross/
I expect you will have some questions when you have looked at the program do not hesitate to contact me again at the hotmail address
  yours sincerely

   Abstract = {This unique book and accompanying CARAT software provides concise, exhaustive, and clear descriptions of terms, notations, concepts, methods, laws, and techniques that are necessary for engineers and researchers dealing with physical and chemical processes in gas and plasma dynamics. This first volume of a multi-volume set covers the dynamics of elementary processes (cross sections and rate coefficients of chemical reactions, ionization and recombination processes, and inter- and intramolecular energy transfer). 

The text and Windows-based computer program CARAT—toolkit from Chemical Workbench model library—carry widely diversified numerical information about 87 models for collision processes in gases and plasmas with participation of atoms, molecules, ions, and electrons. The processes include elastic scattering, electronic-vibration-rotation energy transfer between colliding molecules, and chemical and plasma-chemical reactions. The databases of recommended particle properties and quantitative characteristics of collision processes are built in. Computer implementation of models allows one to calculate cross sections for elastic and inelastic collisions, and rate constants for energy transfer processes and reactions within a wide range of parameters and variables, i.e., the collision energy, gas temperature, etc. Estimates of the accuracy of cross sections and rate coefficients represent an important part of the description of each model.},

Special forms of these expressions are then derived for application to the ionized gas mixtures, in particular to the partially ionized gas.  Convergence of the approximations is checked by computing the properties of fully ionized hydrogen and servral other mixtures where molecules interact inverse-power repulsive potentials.  From the results for hydrogen, it is seen that at least the third approximation should be used for the thermal conductivity and the duffusion conductivity, adn the second approximation for the electrical conductivity and viscosity of ionized gases.  These results contrast with those for un-ionized gases where one lower level of approximation is generally adequate.},

   Abstract = {An investigation is made of some modifications in the kinetic theory of gaseous transport properties which are necessary to take account of effect encountered at high temperatures.  In particular, complications arise because of the existence of a multiplicity of different interaction energy curves governing collisions, and because of the possibility of resonant excitation and charge exchange during collisions.  It is shown that the results of classical kinetic theory can be kept in the same form, but the cross sections or collision integrals have to be computed differently.  It is pointed out that the present modifications are valid to all orders of Chapman-Enskog approximation.  It is also shown tha the excitation exchange is important in deermining the transport properties of mixtures at high temperatures, and the method of calculation of the excitation exchange probability is extended to cases for which multiple interaction curves are involved.},

   Abstract = {A comprehensive textbook and reference for the study of the physics of ionized gases 
The intent of this book is to provide deep physical insight into the behavior of gases containing atoms and molecules from which one or more electrons have been ionized. The study of these so-called plasmas begins with an overview of plasmas as they are found in nature and created in the laboratory. This serves as a prelude to a comprehensive study of plasmas, beginning with low temperature and "ideal" plasmas and extending to radiation and particle transport phenomena, the response of plasmas to external fields, and an insightful treatment of plasma waves, plasma instabilities, nonlinear phenomena in plasmas, and the study of plasma interactions with surfaces. 

In all cases, the emphasis is on a clear and unified understanding of the basic physics that underlies all plasma phenomena. Thus, there are chapters on plasma behavior from the viewpoint of atomic and molecular physics, as well as on the macroscopic phenomena involved in physical kinetics of plasmas and the transport of radiation and of charged particles within plasmas. With this grounding in the fundamental physics of plasmas, the notoriously difficult subjects of nonlinear phenomena and of instabilities in plasmas are then treated with comprehensive clarity.},

   Abstract = {The Spitzer formula for the electrical conductivity of fully ionized gases is modified to permit its application in the nonideal plasma region. A rigorous method of calculating electrical conductivities in partially ionized gases in both ideal and nonideal plasmas is also described. These models are based on the classical Chapman-Enskog approximation with the superposition of binary collisions without the assumption of additional electron scattering mechanisms, such as scattering by plasma oscillations. Good agreement with experiment is obtained in the nonideal region largely through a more adequate treatment of electron screening of the ionic Coulomb potential. The large electron scattering cross section for attractive ion potentials found by Mason et al. [E. A. Mason, R. J. Munn, and F. J. Smith, Phys. Fluids 10, 1827 (1967)] is found to decrease the conductivity in the nonideal region compared to the cross sections of Liboff.},
