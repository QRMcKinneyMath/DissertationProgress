 Similar to in the context of a normed space, if X is a seminormed space, we define the weak topology on X to be the topology on X generated by $X^*$, and the $weak^*$ topology on $X^*$ to be the topology generated by $c(X)$.
Before moving on to the classical theory revamped, I present on more useful result about weak topologies of seminormed spaces. 
\begin{prop}[Weak Quotients]
    \label{prop:weakquotients}
    Let X be a seminormed space and $\{Y_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$ be a collection of topological spaces. For each $\alpha \in A$ let $\phi_\alpha:X \to Y_\alpha$ have the property that for every $x,y \in X$, for every $\alpha \in A$, $\norm{x-y}=0 \implies \phi_\alpha(x)=\phi_\alpha(y)$. 
    For each $\alpha \in A$, define $\tilde{\phi}_\alpha:X/\norm{\cdot}^{-1}\{0\} \to Y_\alpha$ by
    $\tilde{\phi}_{\alpha}[x] = \phi_\alpha x$. Let $\T_w$ denote the weak topology on X induced by $\{\phi_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A}$, and $\T_{\tilde{w}}$ denote the weak topology on $X/\norm{\cdot}^{-1}\{0\}$ induced by $\{\tilde{\phi}_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in A}$. Then 
    \begin{equation}
        (X,\T_w)/\norm{\cdot}^{-1}\{0\} = (X/\norm{\cdot}^{-1}\{0\}, \T_{\tilde{w}})
    \end{equation}
    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof} 
\end{prop} 


Finally, before we move on, recall that if $X,Y$ are Topological vector spaces, we can topologize the set of continuous linear operators from X to Y, denoted $BL(X,Y)$ by saying that $\{T_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in A} \subset BL(X,Y)$ converges to $T \in BL(X,Y)$ if there is a neighborhood U of 0 in X such that $T_{\alpha}x \to Tx$ uniformly for $x \in U$.
